## Brownian Motion

* PHYS3710 Experimental Project
* Last: 25/9/2019
* diffusion simulation: a naive, brief approach
* particles subject to fluid resistance and normal random force
* equation of motion (EOM):
	- mx''+fx' = X (normal)
* aims to verify
	- gaussian distributions of displacements (promised by central limit theorem)
	- linear dependence of variance on time
* outputs:
	- `pos.xyz`: coordinates of particles
	- `data.txt`: time-series statistics, including mean, standard deviation, variance
	- `mu.png`: how mean displacement varies with time
	- `traj.png`: tracer track
	- `var.png`: how squared displacement varies with time
