## Brownian Motion

* PHYS3710 Experimental Project: Simulation
* Last: 28/9/2019
* diffusion simulation: a naive, brief approach
* particles subject to fluid resistance and normal random force
* equation of motion (EOM):
	- mx''+fx' = X (normal)

## Goals

* evolution of mean displacement in time
* linear dependence of squared displacement on time

## Outputs

* `pos.xyz`: coordinates of particles (an animation)
* `data.txt`: time-series statistics, including mean, standard deviation, variance
* `traj.txt`: tracer track coordinates

## Plots

* `traj.png`: tracer track
* `mu.png`: how mean displacement varies with time
* `var.png`: how squared displacement varies with time
